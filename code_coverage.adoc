== Code Coverage with Istanbul

Much of the difficulties had with setting up Istanbul code coverage tooling
were hidden in the details of the test environment setup in the previous
section, specifically with setting up the "alternative mode" file and
sourcemaps.

To configure Istanbul coverage for TypeScript, which works in conjunction with
the JavaScript coverage already included in the configuration files, add the
following.

Install the npm dependency `karma-typescript`.

To webpack.config.js config.module array, add:

    {
      test: /^(?!.*\.spec\.ts$).*\.ts$/,
      include: __dirname + '/src/app/',
      exclude: /(node_modules|\.spec\.ts$)/,
      loader: 'istanbul-instrumenter-loader',
      enforce: 'post',
      options: {
        esModules: true
      }
    }

In tsconfig.json, add `"sourceMap": true` to the `compilerOptions` object.

And in karma.conf.js, add `'karma-typescript'` to the `frameworks` and
`reporters` arrays.
